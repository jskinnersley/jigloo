<span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
The layout for containers/composites
can be set using the context menu or the component/layout palette, and
also by </span><span style="font-family: arial;">using the "Layout"
section of the
"GUI Properties" view</span><span style="font-family: arial;">. <br>
<br>
Layout palette: Choose the layout from the component/layout palette,
and click on the component in the form or in the Outline view.<br>
<br>
Context menu: Right-click on a component and
choose one of the "Set Layout" options. The layout and it's parameters
will be displayed in the "GUI Properties" view, where it can be edited.
Eg, the number of columns, margins, etc for a Grid layout can be set
here.<br>

<h3 style="font-family: arial;"><a name="gridbag_layout"></a>GridBagLayout <br>
</h3><font face="Arial"><br>
</font><font face="Arial">
For the Swing GridBagLayout you can drag the sides of
components to change their gridwidth and gridheight parameters (a
tooltip box will tell you their current values) and you can change the
gridx and gridy values by just dragging the component. The best way to
change the gridx and gridy values is to drag the component by a blue
region of the selection border, instead of clicking and dragging the
interior of the component, since this latter method can change the
parent of the dragged component, while the former method will only
change the grid values.<br>

<font face="Arial">The above container had a grid size of 3 columns and
4 rows. To alter this, set the "columns" and/or "rows" properties of
the container's layout. This will alter the grid, as shown below. Note
that these "columns" and "rows" properties are "synthetic" properties,
and are defined and used by Jigloo to set the GridBagLayout's
columnWeights, columnWidths, rowWeights and rowHeights array
properties. After setting the rows or columns, you can modify the
individual values for columnWeights etc, if needed.</font><br>

<h3 style="font-family: arial;"><a name="jgform_layout"></a>JGoodies FormLayout</h3>

<font face="Arial">The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/forms/index.html">JGoodies FormLayout</a> is supported by Jigloo 3.1. It's
behaviour inside Jigloo is very similar to that of the GridBagLayout,
in that the grid x,y,width and height values can be changed by dragging
the borders of components.<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Tahoma">As with the GridBag layout, if you want to change the preferredSize
property of an element without changing it's gridx, gridy, gridwidth or
gridheight values, then hold the SHIFT key down while dragging a black
section of a selected element's border.<br>
</font><br>
<font face="Arial">
The parameter passed to the FormLayout(colSpecs, rowSpecs) constructor
determines the columns and rows of the layout. Jigloo generates a
default value of <br>
<br>
<font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">new FormLayout("max(p;5px), max(p;5px), max(p;5px), max(p;5px)",<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "max(p;5px),
max(p;5px), max(p;5px), max(p;5px)");<br>
</font><br>
which creates a layout of four columns and four rows, with each cell
having a size of 5 pixels or the preferred size of the element which
occupies that cell (if there is one), whichever one is bigger. You can
change the "colSpecs" and "rowSpecs" for the layout in Jigloo - a "p"
specifies the preferred size, while a number followed by "px" specifies
a size in pixels, so for example "colSpecs={10px, p, 100px, 10px},
rowSpecs={50px, 50px}" will specify a layout with 4 columns and two
rows, with the cells in the second column assuming the preferred widths
of the components which occupy them, and all other cells having
specified widths and heights. <br>
</font><font face="Tahoma"><br>
</font><font face="Arial">
You can read the documentation on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jgoodies.com">jgoodies</a> site for more information on FormLayout. Note that Builders and Factories are not yet supported by Jigloo.<br>
<br>
If you use this layout in your code then you need to include the
forms-1.0.5.jar file in your project's build path. You can find this
jar file in the jigloo plugin folder, or you can download it from the
jgoodies site.<br>
</font><br>

<h3 style="font-family: arial;"><a name="form_anchor_layout"></a>Form
and Anchor Layouts</h3>
<span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
The graphical editing of the SWT FormLayout, and the Swing
com.cloudgarden.layout.AnchorLayout, is similar to the laying-out of
components in the Delphi or Visual Studio graphical editors. Components
can be moved around and resized, but also sides can be anchored so that
when the container is resized components will be resized with it,
maintaining a constant relationship to the container's sides. In
Jigloo, there are two kinds of "anchors" - relative and absolute. If a
side is anchored absolutely then it will remain a fixed distance in
pixels from it's parent's respective side. For instance, if the bottom
side of a component is anchored (with an anchor value of say 100) then
it will remain fixed 100 pixels from the bottom side of it's parent. If
the top side is also anchored (with say a value of 150) then the top
side will remain 150 pixels from the top of it's parent and if it's
parent is stretched vertically then the component will also stretch
vertically.<br>
<br>
To illustrate the effects of anchoring one or both sides absolutely or
relatively, consider this simple button:<br>
<img src="images/anchor1.PNG" title="" alt="" height="118" width="164"><br>
<br>
If both left and right sides are anchored absolutely and the frame is
stretched:<br>
<img src="images/anchor2.PNG" title="" alt="" height="117" width="256"><br>
<br>
If the right side is anchored absolutely but the left side is not
anchored at all:<br>
<img src="images/anchor3.PNG" title="" alt="" height="119" width="255"><br>
<br>
If </span><span style="font-family: arial;">both left and right sides
are anchored <i>relatively</i>:</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial;"><img src="images/anchor4.PNG" title="" alt="" height="117" width="256"><br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: arial;">If the right side is anchored
relatively but the left side is not anchored at all:</span><br>
<span style="font-family: arial;"><img src="images/anchor5.PNG" title="" alt="" height="117" width="257"><br>
<br>
And then one side might be anchored absolutely and the other
relatively. <br>
<br>
In the "Layout" part of the "GUI Properties" editor view, you will see
an "Anchor" entry when the selected component is managed by an Anchor
or Form layout. The value for this label will be something like this:
"[T,r,B]". Upper case means that a side is absolutely anchored, while
lower case implies it is relatively anchored, so the above label means
that the top and bottom sides are absolutely anchored, the right side
is relatively anchored, and the left side is not anchored at all.<br>
<br>
To anchor sides using the editor, either click on the "Anchor" label in
the Layout part of the property editor, or right-click on one or
several
components and
choose the "Anchor..." option. In either case, a dialog will pop up
allowing you to
switch between no/absolute/relative anchoring of each of the four sides.<br>
<img src="images/formLayout.PNG" title="" alt="" height="277" width="245"><br>
<br>
The AnchorLayout for Swing components provides only this anchoring
behaviour, and not the more complex behaviour offered by the SWT
FormLayout. If you select an AnchorLayout for a component then the
com.cloudgarden.layout package will be automatically generated inside
your project, so that the code you need to run your Swing app will all
be there.<br>
<br>
In addition to the "Anchor" options, there are context-menu "Align"
options for components inside Anchor or Form layouts. If you select
multiple components you can choose to align them by their left, center
(horizontally), right, top, center (vertically) or bottom sides, with
the component on which the context menu was opened being the reference
component. You can also choose the "Align components...-&gt;Snap to
grid" option to arrange all the selected components along grid lines
(if a snap-grid is being used).<br>
</span><br style="font-family: arial;">
<h3 style="font-family: arial;"><a name="layout_data"></a>Setting
layout parameters</h3>
<span style="font-family: arial;"><br>
If a component is a child of a
container with a defined layout, (eg, a SWT Button inside a Composite
with a Grid layout) then that Button will have a "Grid Constraints"
entry in the "Layout" part of the GUI Properties view. Below, the GridBag constraints node is opened in the property editor.<br>
<img src="images/layoutConstraints1.PNG" title="" alt="" height="317" width="270"><br style="font-family: arial;">
</span>
<font face="Arial"><br>
For the Swing <b>GridBagLayout</b>, you can drag the sides of
components to change their gridwidth and gridheight parameters (a
tooltip box will tell you their current values) and you can change the
gridx and gridy values by just dragging the component.<br>
<br>
For several kinds of layout (Border, GridBag, SWT Grid, and for
components of a JSplitPane) there are context-menu options for quickly
setting some of these parameters, for instance, the "anchor" and "fill"
parameters for a GridBag layout, or the direction for a Border layout.<br>

<span style="font-family: arial;">It is worthwhile reading the javadoc
for the SWT layouts (and the Swing GridBagLayout) so that these values
make sense to you - and then combine that with some experimentation
inside Jigloo to see the actual effect of setting various layout
parameters. </span><br style="font-family: arial;">
<br style="font-family: arial;">
<span style="font-family: arial;">It is also worthwhile examining the
examples that come with Jigloo to see how certain layout patterns are
created.</span><br>
