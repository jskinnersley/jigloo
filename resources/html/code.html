</b><br>
Jigloo parses the java class to construct the visual representation of
the form. If you edit the code in the source editor then your changes
will be reflected in the form editor. However, this might take a few
seconds, so if you are making lots of changes to the java code you
might want to disable parsing temporarily till you have made your
changes. You can toggle parsing on/off by hitting Ctrl+Alt+P in the
source editor, or hitting the "Toggle Parsing" button in the <a href="outline_page.html">Outline View</a>.<br>
<br>
Jigloo is able to parse most common Java techniques for building GUIs
as adopted by most popular GUI builders. It is also able to accomodate
hand-written code to a certain degree. However, it does have
limitations and these include:<br>
</font></small>
<ul>
  <li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">for or while loops - if multiple components are created or properties set inside a loop then Jigloo will not recognise them.</font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">if/then/else statements - Jigloo will parse all parts of an if/then/else statement. <br>
    </font></small></li>
  <li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">components passed as arguments to methods - if a JPanel is passed to a method which fills that JPanel with JButtons, say.<br>
    </font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Jigloo starts by
parsing the constructors of your class. If it finds a call to other
class methods (eg, if "createComponents" is a method of your class, and
it is called from your constructor), then those methods will be parsed
by jigloo as it encounters the method calls. Similarly, if those
methods call other methods then those methods will be parsed and so on.
If, in the course of parsing the constructors and all the methods
called by the constructors etc, one of the "GUI initialization" methods
is parsed, then jigloo will stop parsing your code. </font><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><i>
  </i></font><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><i>
The "GUI initialization" methods are by default {initGUI,
initComponents, initialize, open, createPartControl, createContents,
createControl and createDialogArea} but this list can be changed in the
  <a href="preferences_page.html">Jigloo Preferences Page</a>.</i> </font><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
  </font><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
If, however, none of the "GUI initialization" methods have been parsed
then Jigloo will search the code for one of these methods (in the order
in which they appear in the list) and will parse the first one it
finds. Eg, if a class has methods "open" and "initialize", then
"initialize" will be parsed because it appears first in the </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"GUI initialization" list. If none of the </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"GUI initialization" methods appear in a class, then every method in the class will be parsed. </font><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
  </font><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
Therefore if you always use a method "initializeGUI", say, to create
your code then you would add "initializeGUI" to the start of the </font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">"GUI initialization" list.</font></small><br>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
  </font><br>
<small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">By default, Jigloo
will not parse code that sets a property of a component outside of the
method in which that component is created. For instance, if a JLabel is
created inside the initGUI method, say, but an event handler for a
JButton's actionPerformed event sets the value of that JLabel's text,
then that value will not be applied to the JLabel in the form editor.
This prevents Jigloo from displaying a GUI which is only visible under
certain conditions (eg, when a button is pressed).<br>
<br>
However, if you *do* wish Jigloo to parse such property-setter calls, then there is a setting in the <a href="preferences_page.html">Preferences Page</a> which allows you to do this.</font></small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
</font><br>


<small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
<b><a name="hiding"></a><big>Hiding code from Jigloo</big></b><br>
<br>
However, Jigloo recognizes certain comment tags which can be used to customize the parsing/code-generation behaviour of Jigloo.<br>
<br>
Code blocks can be hidden from Jigloo using the <b>//$hide&gt;&gt;$</b> and <b>//$hide&lt;&lt;$</b> tags. ie, the </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>//$hide&gt;&gt;$</b> tag should be placed on the line before the start of the block you wish to hide<b>, </b></font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">and the </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>//$hide&lt;&lt;$</b> tag should be placed on the line after the end of the block</font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>. </b></font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Any code inside a block marked by these tags will not be parsed by
Jigloo. </font></small><br>
<small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
If you wish to hide a single line of code, then you can place the customizable <b>//$hide$</b> comment at the end of the line.<br></font></small><br>
<small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">These tags can be customized in the </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><a href="preferences_page.html">Preferences Page</a>.
<br>
<br>
Thus you are able to design a GUI for each case of an if/then clause by hiding one half of the clause at a time.<br>

<br>
</b></font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
Code blocks can also be protected from being modified by Jigloo by using the customizable <b>//$protect&gt;&gt;$ </b>and </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>//$protect&lt;&lt;$ </b>(and </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>//$protect$</b>) tags, in the same was as the tags for hiding code. </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">These tags can also be customized in the </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><a href="preferences_page.html">Preferences Page</a>. </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Any code marked by these tags will not be modified, though Jigloo may add lines of code inside those blocks.<br>

<a name="class_creation"></a><b><big>Class Instantiation</big></b><br></font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small><br>
</small></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">As jigloo tries
to render your GUI in it's Form Editor, it needs to insantiate the
visual classes used and also any classes which are used as properties
of these visual classes. Also, if a method is called on a visual class
then Jigloo will try and instantiate the classes passed as parameters
for this method. However, Jigloo will not instantiate any other
classes. If you find that Jigloo is instantiating a class that you do
not want it to instantiate, add this class to the "Forbidden
superclasses" list in the "Class creation" tab of </font></small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>the <a href="preferences_page.html">Jigloo Preferences Page</a>. </small></font><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You can define single classes or packages of superclasses which can or
cannot be instantiated. Note, you are specifying superclasses, so if
you allow/deny a superclass, then you are also allowing/denying any
extensions of that superclass.</font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"></font></small><br>

<small><a name="ext_strings"></a><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><big>Externalizing Strings</big></b></font><br>

<br>
</small><span style="font-family: arial;"><small><b>Note:</b> If you are working on classes created by Jigloo 2.7.2 which use
the getExternalizedString method, then you will need to change this
method to be static before Jigloo 3.0 will be able to get the value of
the externalized string.</small><br>
<br>
</span>


<span style="font-family: arial;"><small>Jigloo recognizes Strings
externalized by Eclipse's "externalize strings" action, which creates a
ResourceBundle accessor class and the appropriate calls in your code.<br>
<br>

Jigloo will parse these calls, search for the properties file related
to the ResourceBundle, and display the externalized string in the Form
Editor. If it can't find the properties file, or the project has not
been built yet, then it will display the key for the externalized
string surrounded by "$" signs.</small>
<br>
<br>
<b><br>
<a name="code_gen"></a>Code Generation<br>
<br>
</b></span><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Jigloo will generate new code in accordance with the user-defined preferences set in the Jigloo <a href="preferences_page.html#generation">preferences page.</a> You can choose whether to generate elements inside getter methods
(available for Swing forms only) or whether to enclose them inside
braces, comment tags or blank lines. The advantages of enclosing
elements inside braces are:<br>
</font></small>
<ul>
<li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">when an element
is moved, if you have placed any custom code relating directly to that
element inside it's braces then that custom code will be guaranteed to
be moved also. If braces are not used then that code might or might not
be moved, and should probably be placed inside a totally separate
method instead.</font></small></li><li><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">though unusual, nested braces can actually clarify the parent-child relationships peculiar to GUI code.</font></small></li>
</ul>
<small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you change
your code-generation style, you may want to completely re-format your
code according to the new style (say, you decide to change from using
spaces to separate code elements to using braces). </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> Jigloo does not do this automatically since it is a time-consuming operation. </font></small><small><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">After changing your
preference, you can right-click on the form editor and choose the
"Source-&gt;Reformat code to current coding style" option. <br>
<br>
You can also use this powerful option to re-format code generated by hand or by other GUI builders.<br>
<br>
<b>Note on converting from getters:</b> If you are converting from
using getters to using code blocks, the getter methods will be deleted
from the code, so that if you are explicitly calling these getters from
your own code, or from other classes, these getters will need to be
regenerated to return the corresponding fields - but the Eclipse
context menu options can be used to do this easily. Any references to
the getter methods from code that is being controlled by Jigloo,
however, will be changed to refer directly to the fields themselves, so
the code will only need to be repaired if, for example, you are calling
myJFrame.getJPanel1() from an external class after reformatting
MyJFrame to not use getters..<br>
