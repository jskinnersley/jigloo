<big><b>Outline View</b></big><br>
<br>
The Outline View
is where the parts of the GUI you are building are layed out in a tree
format.<br>
<br>
</small><small><img src="images/outline1.PNG" title="" alt="" width="283" height="285" align="top"><br>
<br>
</small><small>There are three root nodes of the tree:</small><br>
</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>Extra components - these include the menu bar and visual components which do not have a parent</small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>Non-visual components - these include all non-trivial non-visual components like models for JComboBoxes, ButtonGroups etc</small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>the root visual component.</small><br>
    </font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>The outline view is useful for:<br>
</small></font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>selecting components (click on one or more components)<br>
    </small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>moving components (just drag components around the tree)<br>
    </small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>copying/pasting
components (eg, on Windows platforms, hold down Ctrl while dragging a
component to paste a copy of the component).</small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>adding
components using the context menu - right-click on a component and
choose the component to add (if these menu options are enabled in the <a href="preferences_page.html">Preferences Page</a>).</small></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small><b><big><br>
<a name="actions"></a>Editor Actions<br>
<br>
</big></b>The other use of the outline page is as a holder for six editor actions.<br>
<br>
</small></font><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>At the top or left of
the outline you will see these six icons: <img src="images/outline_actions.PNG" title="" alt="" width="141" height="23">. <br>
<br>
From left-to-right, these are:</small><br>
</font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>The
"Grid size" button - pressing multiple times reveals or hides a
snap-grid of various sizes which, when visible, is used by Jigloo to
align the edges of the components.</small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>The "Preview" button, which pops up a preview of the form which you can interact with, before saving and compiling the code.</small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>The "Run" button, which is a short-cut to compiling and running the code.</small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>The "Parsing" button
- this toggles code-parsing on and off - if you are going to be typing
a significant amount into the java editor you might want to turn
parsing off so that Jigloo does not waste time trying to parse the code
as you are changing it. Then once you are finished you can turn parsing
on again and Jigloo will incorporate your code changes. You can also
toggle parsing by hitting Alt+Ctrl+P in the java editor. If parsing is
disabled a" <img src="images/parsing_off.gif" title="" alt="" width="16" height="16">parsing disabled" label will appear in the form editor. When Jigloo is parsing the code a "<img src="images/parsing_now.gif" title="" alt="" width="16" height="16">parsing..." label will appear temporarily.</small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>The "Inheritance"
button - this toggles the display of inherited or publically-accessible
fields. If it is blue then only directly-inherited fields are shown; if
it is green then all inherited fields are shown; if it is red then no
inherited fields are shown. In the screen shot of the outline view you
can see several publically-accessible fields of included classes (eg,
the FlowerPanel.flowerLabel field) as well as fields inherited from the
superclass (eg, the shopPanel field which is inherited from the
ShopFrame class, which is the FlowerShop's superclass).</small></font></li>
  <li><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><small>The "Swing/SWT Toggle", which will convert the GUI between Swing and SWT.</small></font></li>
</ul>
